# Code Challenge Word Count (CCWC)

This is a Java program I've developed for a word count challenge. It provides functionality to perform various counting operations on a text file.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need:

- Java installed on your computer.
- Download the `ccwc.java` file from this repository.
- Prepare `.txt` files for testing purposes. Ensure they are in the same directory as `ccwc.java`.

## Instructions

Follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Program**: Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing `ccwc.java`. Compile the program using the Java compiler:
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled Java program:
3. **View the Output**: The program will prompt you to enter the name of the text file you want to analyze and the counting operation you want to perform (`-c`, `-l`, `-m`, or `-w`). After providing the input, the program will display the result.


## Documentation

The program supports four options for counting operations:

- `-c`: Counts the number of bytes in the file.
- `-l`: Counts the number of lines in the file.
- `-m`: Counts the number of characters in the file.
- `-w`: Counts the number of words in the file.
